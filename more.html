                     <h3>Why Reduce Bullying?</h3>
                     <hr>
                     <p>Bullying can have serious and ongoing impacts on people's mental health and wellbeing. 
                        Many studies that show that people who are bullied are more likely to experience mental health issues, 
                        such as depression, anxiety and even suicidal thoughts. As with any health condition, mental health problems 
                        can affect a person's work and cause substantial costs to organisations (BusinessNZ, 2013). For workplaces, 
                        it's their legal responsibility under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 to manage risks to mental health 
                        and wellbeing just like they do any other health and safety risk</p>

                     <hr>
                     <p>Pink Shirt Day aims to reduce bullying by celebrating diversity in all its forms and supporting workplaces, 
                        communities and schools to be safe, supportive, welcoming and inclusive of all people. While all people can be the target of bullying, 
                        some groups or individuals experience more bullying than others.</p>
